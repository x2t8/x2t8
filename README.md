# x2t8
Minimalist. Builder. System-oriented.

## About
I build software that stays quiet, local, and under control.  
Currently exploring systems, security, low-level execution, and correctness through formal methods.

## Focus
- System-oriented development & tooling
- Local-first, low-level thinking
- Security & execution correctness
- Formal verification (learning & applying Coq)
- Full-stack with strong frontend (React / React Native)

## Stack
- Languages: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript
- Exploring: Coq (formal methods)
- Frontend: React, React Native
- Runtime: Node.js
- Tools: Git, Linux, Docker

> Quiet software lasts longer. Correct software lasts longer still.
