# Arvid Falkner
Minimalist. Builder. System-oriented.

---

I build software that stays quiet, local, and under control.  
Not everything needs to be loud to be correct.

---

## Focus
- System-oriented development & tooling  
- Security & execution correctness  
- Low-level thinking, local-first design  
- Learning formal verification (Coq)  
- Full-stack when interfaces matter (React / React Native)

---

## Stack
**Languages**: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Exploring**: Coq (formal methods)  
**Frontend**: React, React Native  
**Runtime**: Node.js  
**Tools**: Git, Linux, Docker

---

## Projects
- **[Naux](https://github.com/x2t8/Naux)** — Rust-based executor tool  
- Ongoing systems & formal verification work (private / experimental)
